Hence the following baseline scenario is applicable for this project activity:
“The net quantity of treated ETP effluent / wastewater that would be discharged directly into the local
drain/sewer without further being recycled and/or reused daily post treatment per year”


The net quantity of treated water used is measured via flow meters installed at the site. Also, for conservative purposes, the working days or operational days have been assumed at 330 days in a year during the 1st monitoring period (01/01/2014 to 31/12/2023). However, the number of days is
not an influential parameter on RoUs calculation as RoUs are calculated based on total quantity of
treated water being recycled & reused.
